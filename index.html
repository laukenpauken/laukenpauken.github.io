                    <p>A web application that tracks delayed & canceled trains between Uppsala and Stockholm, built with
                        Python, Flask, SQLite, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.</p>

                    <p>This project started as a Python script using Trafikverket's API (REST) to collect and process
                        train data. I later implemented OOP principles to structure data handling efficiently and only
                        return late/canceled trains. To store and display the data, I built a full-stack solution using
                        only vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>

                    <p>For automation, I designed a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to fetch new data daily, append
                        it to a Render-hosted database, and deploy the updated site to Cloudflare. What I did not know
                        was that the free tier on Render removed the database once the data was uploaded and I spent
                        many hours debugging why my database only had the previous days data. Therefore you can
                        currently only access the previous days data.</p>

                    <p>I am currently working on hosting a database locally on a Raspberry Pi to learn more about
                        utilizing the device. Before proceeding, I am taking the time to read about and understand the
                        risks associated with hosting a database on a local network.</p>

                    <h2>Tamata</h2>
                    <p>A puzzle game inspired by the classic Game Boy title Kwirk, built with Python's PyGame.</p>

                    <p>The project started during Christmas at my parents house to experiment a bit with PyGame, chosen
                        for its hands-on approach
                        requiring manual implementation of movement, collision detection, and game mechanics. I designed
                        the game structure using the Game Loop, Command, and Observer design patterns. While the game
                        currently features only one level, the focus has currently been on robust design and clean
                        project structure rather than content.</p>

                    <p>I am currently working on composing the main theme, sound effects and creating some more sprites
                        for future levels. This project serves mainly as a creative outlet rather than aiming for a
                        release.</p>

                    <h2>Dungeons & Dragons Soundboard</h2>
                    <p>As an avid Dungeons & Dragons player, I created this soundboard to help my Dungeon Master solve a
                        challenge he faced during our sessions. Managing multiple YouTube tabs for background music and
                        ambience was cumbersome and disrupted the flow of the game.</p>

                    <p>I created a simple virtual soundboard that allows the user to assign YouTube links to tiles in a
                        grid-based interface. By pressing a tile, the sound plays instantly, making it easier to switch
                        between tracks and amplify the game atmosphere.</p>

                    <p>The application is lightweight and runs locally in a web browser, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                        and Flask.</p>
